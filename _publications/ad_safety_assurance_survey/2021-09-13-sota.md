# Abstract
More effective, efficient and flexible ways to manage safety assurance are needed for the successful development and release of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). In this paper we propose a set of desired assurance method criteria and present an initial overview of available safety assurance methods and how they contribute to the proposed criteria. We observe that there is a significant gap between the state-of-the-art research and the state-of-practise for safety assurance of ADSs and propose to investigate reasons for this as future work. A next step will be to investigate how to merge the elements from the different assurance methods to achieve a method addressing all criteria.
